Package name must strictly follow the rules inspired by RPM:

<package_id>-<version>-<build>.<architecture>.pundit

Obviously there are limitation in the form of the subset of the characters allowed to use in the package_id and platform part of the name due to the limitations of the filesystem file names.

Allowed characters:
a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '_'


<package_id>
The package name limited by "allowed characters"

<version>
Three-number version number in form of X.Y.Z

<build>
The build number, which is a contuniously increasing number through the lifecycle of the <package_id>

<architecture>
Specifies the package target architecture.
There are a number of reserved identifiers and recommended ids you must use:

noarch - the package does not target any architecture (used by default). Can be used to package resource data like images, video, etc.
src - the package contains only source. 
x86 - the binary is built for general 32-bit processor architecture
x64 - the binary is built for general 64-bit processor architecture

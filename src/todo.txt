+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
- if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead
= install includes
- install tools and other
- check that all dependencies are valid when publishing
- sometimes VS locks XML documentation files in the LIB folder, think what to do with that

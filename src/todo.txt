not scheduled:
high priority:

1.2.0
- refactor RepositoryStreamer to use compression methods different from ZIP (for example 7z)

1.1.0
- optimize dependency resolution to use less calls to IRepository, better batching
- check that all dependencies are valid when publishing
- support platform compatibility i.e. if manifest declares platform net40, use it as a default one
  after noarch, then try to use net35, net30 and net20
- would be nice to have a special case for .NET assemblies, when the whole package is a single
  .NET assembly. Autopackage dll, pdb, xml, get versions and other info.

1.0.0.27
- improve conflict explanation

1.0.0.26
- for local builds figure out how a script can pickup a version from repository to generate a newer next one.
- http://pundit.codeplex.com/workitem/13528 (stable/unstable packages)
- "search" command should have a key to give xml-ready result
- add SRC folder as default search path for pundit.xml. Root takes priority, then SRC. The problem
  is that most VS plugins won't pickup SVN updates in root folder so manifest is never updated.
- publishing IRepository via network causes performance issues, should be redesigned with snapshots (like dpkg) and
  in future with changesets to snapshots

1.0.0.25
+ simplify "search" command, "pundit search -t:text" looks ugly, should be "pundit search text"
= add another option tab with VSIX options (checkbox whether to ping in background, refresh, frequency). Save settings globally.
= check for dependencies in background and notify the user in the toolbar
- console commands for modifying repository list
- adding/changing repository should validate it before saving both in VSIX and console tools

1.0.0.24
+ allow to disable repository without deleting it
+ "info" command printing out registered repositories
+ pundit resolve has new -p parameter
+ extended tools/options with repositories contiguration
+ CORE: abstract output for console commands, copy them to Pundit Console tool window in VSIX
+ all console commands should use passed root folder instead of current directory
+ VSIX: conflict causes VS to crash - move dependency resolution to console
+ "resolve" button should open the pundit console and start the resolution process there, currently it's broken

1.0.0.x
+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
+ ability to install both release and debug configurations of a library; added third configuration
instead - "any" which contains files common to both configurations; if a library publisher
requires a user to use both debug and release libraries at the same time (like boost) then
he just publishes them as configuration="any" (which is a default configuration now)
+ if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead;
"any" is always used
+ install includes
+ install tools and other
+ ignore XML documentation files overwrite errors in the LIB folder which VS sometimes stupidly locks
just ignore all XML files
+ VSIX: configure global settings
+ throw out log4net, all the algorithms must throw progress events to indicate something is happening instead
  of logging; this will allow to adopt them both to console and UI
+ ResolveCommand was using LocalRepository which lost log4net logging, must use new events now to display the same level of info
+ VSIX: "Package Dependencies" dialog.
+ CORE: do not reinstall the whole folder if a dependency changed, update only the dependency;
  apparently the whole lib folder content shouldn't be deleted when resolve fails
+ VSIX: dependency resolution ("resolve" command analog)
+ CONSOLE: "pack" is "broken", it won't display the packaging progress
+ FORMS: add options for "createPlatformFolder" and "scope"

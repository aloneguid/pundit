2.0.0
= drop sqlite replacing with a custom directory-based solution
= check for updates in background once a day
= resolve progress should look normal
= resolve progress should look normal in VSIX too
+ create sqlite-based local repository
  + all the cached binaries must reside in the local sqlite db file
  + repository cache (local or remote one) must be in the local db
  + redesign IRepository to work with the local db
  + home folder now needs only single pundit.db file so all configuration files and subfolders can be removed
+ add local data file location to "repo list"
+ console commands for modifying repository list;  
  + adding/deleting repository (add now validates before saving)
  + updating repository properties
+ snapshot sync - restore directory-based repository to test (dir:// protocol)
+ IRemoteRepository synchronisation
+ restore "pundit publish" using IRemoteRepository; after publishing local index has to be force-refreshed
+ progress bars support in console mode
+ bug: "pundit resolve" doesn't notify about operation completion
+ analyze and test every command
 + Pack & Resolve
 + Publish (implemented in server and tested)
 + RepositoryServer change history (add and del changes)
 + LocalRepository accepting add and del changes
 + Search

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.0.27
+ "search" command now can output result in xml
+ Pundit Console bugs
+ settings
+ add another option tab with VSIX options (checkbox whether to ping in background, refresh, frequency). Save settings globally.

1.0.0.26
1.0.0.25
+ simplify "search" command, "pundit search -t:text" looks ugly, should be "pundit search text"
+ bug: vsix 

1.0.0.24
+ allow to disable repository without deleting it
+ "info" command printing out registered repositories
+ pundit resolve has new -p parameter
+ extended tools/options with repositories contiguration
+ CORE: abstract output for console commands, copy them to Pundit Console tool window in VSIX
+ all console commands should use passed root folder instead of current directory
+ VSIX: conflict causes VS to crash - move dependency resolution to console
+ "resolve" button should open the pundit console and start the resolution process there, currently it's broken

1.0.0.x
+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
+ ability to install both release and debug configurations of a library; added third configuration
instead - "any" which contains files common to both configurations; if a library publisher
requires a user to use both debug and release libraries at the same time (like boost) then
he just publishes them as configuration="any" (which is a default configuration now)
+ if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead;
"any" is always used
+ install includes
+ install tools and other
+ ignore XML documentation files overwrite errors in the LIB folder which VS sometimes stupidly locks
just ignore all XML files
+ VSIX: configure global settings
+ throw out log4net, all the algorithms must throw progress events to indicate something is happening instead
  of logging; this will allow to adopt them both to console and UI
+ ResolveCommand was using LocalRepository which lost log4net logging, must use new events now to display the same level of info
+ VSIX: "Package Dependencies" dialog.
+ CORE: do not reinstall the whole folder if a dependency changed, update only the dependency;
  apparently the whole lib folder content shouldn't be deleted when resolve fails
+ VSIX: dependency resolution ("resolve" command analog)
+ CONSOLE: "pack" is "broken", it won't display the packaging progress
+ FORMS: add options for "createPlatformFolder" and "scope"

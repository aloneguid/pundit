1.1.0.2

1.1.0.1
- refactor RepositoryStreamer to use compression methods different from ZIP (for example 7z)
- would be nice to have a special case for .NET assemblies, when the whole package is a single
  .NET assembly. Autopackage dll, pdb, xml, get versions and other info.
- for local builds figure out how a script can pickup a version from repository to generate a newer next one.
- http://pundit.codeplex.com/workitem/13528 (stable/unstable packages)
- creating new manifests is really annoying
- utilize threads when updating snapshots
- utilize threads when downloading missing binaries
- refactor: push strings from console commands to resources
- refactor: push strings from exceptions to resources
- add nuget adapter as more and more opensource libs are now moving to nuget
- for windows dlls included in the package check that version information at least comes from same company, otherwise
  display an error "error checking package integrity, are you mixing libraries from several vendors in the same package?"
- improve conflict explanation
- pundit resolve should show package size before downloading

VSIX:
- check for dependencies in background and notify the user in the toolbar

1.1.0.0 (Bloody Duck)
CORE:
+ create sqlite-based local repository
  + all the cached binaries must reside in the local sqlite db file
  + repository cache (local or remote one) must be in the local db
  + redesign IRepository to work with the local db
  + home folder now needs only single pundit.db file so all configuration files and subfolders can be removed
+ add local data file location to "repo list"
+ console commands for modifying repository list;  
  + adding/deleting repository (add now validates before saving)
  + updating repository properties
+ snapshot sync - restore directory-based repository to test (dir:// protocol)
+ IRemoteRepository synchronisation
+ restore "pundit publish" using IRemoteRepository; after publishing local index has to be force-refreshed
+ progress bars support in console mode
+ bug: "pundit resolve" doesn't notify about operation completion
= analyze and test every command
 + Pack & Resolve
 = Publish (including http service test)
 - Repo
 - Search
 - Template
 - Utils
= pundit http server
  + db design
  + publishing over http, adding manifest and history record
  = getting history and snapshots via http
  - binary http downloads
  - limit number of stored binary revisions (configurable)

VSIX:
- support new console output
= analyze and test every command
 - Pack & Resolve
 - Publish
 - Repo
 - Search
 - Template
 - Utils

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0.0.27
+ "search" command now can output result in xml
+ Pundit Console bugs
+ settings
+ add another option tab with VSIX options (checkbox whether to ping in background, refresh, frequency). Save settings globally.

1.0.0.26
1.0.0.25
+ simplify "search" command, "pundit search -t:text" looks ugly, should be "pundit search text"
+ bug: vsix 

1.0.0.24
+ allow to disable repository without deleting it
+ "info" command printing out registered repositories
+ pundit resolve has new -p parameter
+ extended tools/options with repositories contiguration
+ CORE: abstract output for console commands, copy them to Pundit Console tool window in VSIX
+ all console commands should use passed root folder instead of current directory
+ VSIX: conflict causes VS to crash - move dependency resolution to console
+ "resolve" button should open the pundit console and start the resolution process there, currently it's broken

1.0.0.x
+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
+ ability to install both release and debug configurations of a library; added third configuration
instead - "any" which contains files common to both configurations; if a library publisher
requires a user to use both debug and release libraries at the same time (like boost) then
he just publishes them as configuration="any" (which is a default configuration now)
+ if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead;
"any" is always used
+ install includes
+ install tools and other
+ ignore XML documentation files overwrite errors in the LIB folder which VS sometimes stupidly locks
just ignore all XML files
+ VSIX: configure global settings
+ throw out log4net, all the algorithms must throw progress events to indicate something is happening instead
  of logging; this will allow to adopt them both to console and UI
+ ResolveCommand was using LocalRepository which lost log4net logging, must use new events now to display the same level of info
+ VSIX: "Package Dependencies" dialog.
+ CORE: do not reinstall the whole folder if a dependency changed, update only the dependency;
  apparently the whole lib folder content shouldn't be deleted when resolve fails
+ VSIX: dependency resolution ("resolve" command analog)
+ CONSOLE: "pack" is "broken", it won't display the packaging progress
+ FORMS: add options for "createPlatformFolder" and "scope"


1.2.0
- repository server
- refactor RepositoryStreamer to use compression methods different from ZIP (for example 7z)

1.1.0
- optimize dependency resolution to use less calls to IRepository, better batching

1.0.0
+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
+ ability to install both release and debug configurations of a library; added third configuration
instead - "any" which contains files common to both configurations; if a library publisher
requires a user to use both debug and release libraries at the same time (like boost) then
he just publishes them as configuration="any" (which is a default configuration now)
+ if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead;
"any" is always used
+ install includes
+ install tools and other
+ ignore XML documentation files overwrite errors in the LIB folder which VS sometimes stupidly locks
just ignore all XML files
- support platform compatibility i.e. if manifest declares platform net40, use it as a default one
after noarch, then try to use net35, net30 and net20
- check that all dependencies are valid when publishing
- do not reinstall the whole folder if a dependency changed, update only the dependency;
  apparently the whole lib folder content shouldn't be deleted when resolve fails
- throw out log4net, all the algorithms must throw progress events to indicate something is happening instead
  of logging; this will allow to adopt them both to console and UI
- ResolveCommand was using LocalRepository which lost log4net logging, must use new events now to display the same level of info

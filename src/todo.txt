
1.2.0
- repository server
- refactor RepositoryStreamer to use compression methods different from ZIP (for example 7z)

1.1.0
- optimize dependency resolution to use less calls to IRepository, better batching

1.0.0
+ support devtime packages
+ repository search command
+ don't delete lib, other, include, tools folders when re-setting folders
+ ability to install both release and debug configurations of a library; added third configuration
instead - "any" which contains files common to both configurations; if a library publisher
requires a user to use both debug and release libraries at the same time (like boost) then
he just publishes them as configuration="any" (which is a default configuration now)
+ if the package doesn't have DEBUG configuration and debug is requested, use release instead;
"any" is always used
= install includes
= install tools and other
- check that all dependencies are valid when publishing
- sometimes VS locks XML documentation files in the LIB folder, think what to do with that; probably
just ignore all XML files
- support platform compatibility i.e. if manifest declares platform net40, use it as a default one
after noarch, then try to use net35, net30 and net20.

AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion have a very special meaning to .NET CLR.
  If there is any .NET assembly in the package's LIB folder, pundit should force package version
  to the .NET assembly version.
  If there is more than one .NET assembly in the package's LIB folder, and their AssemblyVersion
  don't match, pundit shouldn't build such a package at all.
  As a consequence dev time references can contain any possible version pattern, however published
  references can't, they MUST reference exact package version (not including package build version)
  or package version + pattern of package build version. For example, if package version is 1.2 and
  package build version is 1.2.45.889, then published version can be 1.2 or 1.2.45 or 1.2.45.889.
